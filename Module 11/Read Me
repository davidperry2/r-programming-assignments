I was attempting to write a simple R function that would return a logical vector indicating which rows were outliers in every column using the Tukey method. Predictably, it crashed on the first line. The first error message indicated that I was missing a helper function, but after that was corrected, the actual error was that I used && instead of &. In that simple mistyping, the error went from something requiring R function creation knowledge to R simply looking at the first entry of every column.

After replacing the characters, it worked perfectly, with no errors, clean logical output, and a nice lesson in how minor syntactic errors can destroy your intended logic. Debugging R: sometimes it is not about learning a deep conceptual piece of R wisdom, but rather understanding which operator does what.
