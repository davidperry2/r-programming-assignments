For Assignment #8 I first read the Assignment 6 data into R using read.csv() as it was comma-delimited, then used ddply() from the plyr package to group the data by Sex and get the mean Grade for each group, writing the result to gender_mean.txt. After that I filtered the dataset to include only students whose name had the letter "i" or "I" with grepl("i", Name, ignore.case=T) and saved just their names to i_students.csv and the full filtered data to i_students_full.csv. Finally I verified that all three files existed in my working directory and everything worked correctly. The script runs fine now and all outputs are in my GitHub repo.
