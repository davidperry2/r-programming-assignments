I started the assignment with some data cleaning and created plots in RStudio. The assignment had a list that told me how many patients there were, how often they came to the clinic, their blood pressure, and gave me three assessments. I needed to translate the data into ones and zeros so the code could understand it, then dropped the NA value. After that, I was able to plug everything in.

For the boxplots, blood pressure was generally higher in the “bad” and “high” groups compared to the “good” and “low” groups, which I assume would be the case in a real-world hospital list, since most people in the hospital would need to have their blood pressure checked. Although the spread was wider in that group of patients, one patient had a far more extreme blood pressure value than the others, exceeding 200. The first doctor’s assessment clearly split the patients, and the decision seemed to follow the same pattern. Of course, worse assessments typically correspond to higher blood pressures.

The histograms showed that visit frequency was mainly between 0.2 and 0.6, with one person visiting much more often. Blood pressure was not stable in the slightest, with some readings as low as 30–40, but also some very high ones. This suggests a mix of stable and unstable patients in the data. Since this is made-up data, the clinical significance is limited; however, if it were real, the high outliers would definitely require immediate attention.

One last note, dropping the NA reduced the dataset to 9 patients. With so few cases, it is challenging to draw any generalizations. Still, the plots do show the relationship between blood pressure and how the doctors assessed the patients. Not the most polished write-up, but the code runs, the plots are there, and the patterns are visible.
