For the data frame, I chose mtcars from the datasets because it was already there and simple. I created two plots in each environment to get a feel for the differences. I did not spend much time on plot cosmetics because the goal was to get it to work. Base R was the fastest by far; lattice will do the job for multi-panel plots, and ggplot2, with little effort, produced the nicest-looking plots. ggplot2 has a clean, modern feel. Base seems more geared toward getting quick results for on-the-fly questions. Latticrt of in between, but not as customizable. Overall, ggplot2 generated the most "publish-ready" looking plots.
