# Introduction

R Markdown is a framework that allows you to combine **narrative text**, **R code**, and **LaTeX math** into one reproducible document. When knitted, it produces a nicely formatted report (HTML, PDF, or Word) that captures your analysis, figures, and explanations all in one place.

$$
\int_0^1 x^2\, dx = \frac{1}{3}
$$
Working with R Markdown makes it easy to blend narrative writing with reproducible code. I found that mixing code chunks with explanatory text provides a much clearer workflow than writing a standard word-processor report. Knitting to HTML was straightforward, though I needed to watch out for missing packages or improperly closed code chunks.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data(mpg)

summary(mpg$hwy)

ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, color = class)) +
geom_point() +
theme_minimal()
