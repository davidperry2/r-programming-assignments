Looking at the results, the most obvious pattern is the significant difference in numbers between Donald and everyone else both ABC and CBS have him far ahead. Another interesting discrepancy is between Hillary and Bernie, who are closer in CBS but further apart in ABC. That difference illustrates how the poll source can alter the apparent race. The Diff column makes it easy to see who benefits more from CBS versus ABC, with Hillary, for example, doing noticeably better in CBS.

That said, the dataset is entirely fabricated, which limits what we can actually say. Because it is not drawn from real polling, it cannot be generalized to actual voter preferences. Using fake numbers is acceptable for learning code, but any conclusions drawn from this exercise would be misleading if applied outside of it.

As well as the limitations of Rstudios really showed up in this assignment, specifically, how weird it can be to get easy-to-read graphs. I went further than I needed to, so I could get something worth reading. In the end, the graph clearly illustrates the trend of the data, although it may be challenging to apply to situations outside of the hypothetical scenario presented in this assignment.
