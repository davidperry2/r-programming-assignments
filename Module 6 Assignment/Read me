I created the A and B matrices and then performed element-by-element operations, primarily addition and subtraction. Next, using diag() to make a 4×4 diagonal matrix with values 4, 1, 2, 3. Finally, I put it together for the 5×5 custom matrix by filling in the first row and column, then placing a 4×4 diagonal block of 3s in the corner. Everything runs fine and prints the correct results.
